## Community backed

**It is expected that all developers either [become a Patron](https://opencollective.com/nservicebusextensions/contribute/patron-6976) or have a [Tidelift Subscription](#support-via-tidelift) to use NServiceBusExtensions. [Go to licensing FAQ](https://github.com/NServiceBusExtensions/Home/#licensingpatron-faq)**

## NuGet package

https://nuget.org/packages/Verify.NServiceBus/


## Usage

Before any test have run call:

```
VerifyNServiceBus.Enable();
```


### Verifying a context

Given the following handler:

snippet: SimpleHandler

The test that verifies the resulting context:

snippet: HandlerTest

The resulting context verification file is as follows:

snippet: MessageHandlerTests.VerifyHandlerResult.verified.txt


### Example behavior change

The next time there is a code change, that results in a different resulting interactions with NServiceBus, those changes can be visualized. For example if the `DelayDeliveryWith` is changed from 12 hours to 1 day:

snippet: SimpleHandlerV2

Then the resulting visualization diff would look as follows:


![visualization diff](/src/approvaltests-diff.png)


### Message to Handler mapping

`MessageToHandlerMap` allows verification of message that do not have a handler.

For example:

snippet: MessageToHandlerMap

Would result in: 

snippet: MessageToHandlerMapTests.Integration.verified.txt
